* Description: 

This is the work I completed as a second semester Junior in College with Dr. Dennis Brylow as my teacher at Marquette University. Note that the xinu-hw9
branch is the functionin xinu-hw9. The xinu-hw9 in the Ginshu file has its getmem completely messed up and probably its freemem too.
